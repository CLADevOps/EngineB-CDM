# EngineB-Audit-CDM v1.2

Common Data Model 

A Common Data Model provides shared data language for business and analytical applications to use.
The Common Data Model allows apps to integrate and share data with each other without the need for sizable, custom integration - providing a centralised point where systems can come together and connect, thus sharing information which was once divided by a digital language barrier.
 
Audit CDM 

The Audit CDM provides the ability to integrate and share data across various accounting and audit platforms â€“ providing a transparency of information and key concepts. 
Engine B has successfully mapped accounting and audit entities of structured and unstructured data from multiple platforms providing the bases for key analysis to help determine inconsistencies and for visual representation - examples include anomaly detection and knowledge graphs respectively.

Updated the Audit CDM to include the Data Dictionary for the entities.
