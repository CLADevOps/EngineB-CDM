Human Resources 

Human Resource accounting is the process of identifying and reporting on data/activities about human resources within an organisation which can then be used to 
communicate to interested parties. This includes the measurement costs/ investments associated with the recruitment, placement, training and development of human assets. 
Quantifying the economic value of the people within the organisation assists with decisions making and control measures.
