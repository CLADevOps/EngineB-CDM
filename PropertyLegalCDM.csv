Projects pursuing LEED certification earn points across several categories, including energy use and air quality. Based on the number of points achieved, a project then earns one of four LEED rating levels: Certified, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Certified - 40-49 points earned Silver - 50-59 points earned Gold - 60-79 points earned Platinum - 80+ points earned",
