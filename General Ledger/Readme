General Ledger

A general ledger is an account or record used to sort, store and summerise transactions within a given period.  
The general ledger transactions are then arranged to create financial reports such as Income Statement, Statement of Financial Position and 
Cashflow Statements â€“ subject to accounting rules. These statements can then be used for control, reporting and for communication.
