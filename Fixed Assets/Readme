Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are long term tangible assets such as property, plant and equipment that the organisation owns and uses in its operations to generate income. Given these assets are 
fixed, they are not expected to be consumed or converted into cash within a year. Fixed assets are subject to depreciation to account for the loss in value as the assets are used. 
Fixed assets that are intangible, also used in the long term but simply lack physical existence are considered as non-current assets.  
For example, goodwill and copyrights - these are subject to be amortized.
